-   **Drag and Drop:**  Reorder list items within the hierarchy.
-   **Expand/Collapse:** Expand and collapse parent items to show/hide children.
-   **Mobile Support:** Uses `react-device-detect` for a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Data:** Initial data is in `src/data/inital-items.ts`.
